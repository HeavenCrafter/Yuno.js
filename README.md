# Yuno.js
This bot is a fork of [Rushnett's starboard](https://github.com/Rushnett/starboard) but modified to fit for **HeavenHell Entertainment** Discord. Bot token login methods are changed since the original starboard is logged in via a config.json file. It has been changed to use .env files usage instead of a config.json format.

# Starboard
Starboard (also known as the smugboardâ„¢) is a Discordjs bot originally created (and still running) for moonmoon's discord server. It allows users to react to messages on a given server, and pin messages that reach a threshold to a special channel. This implementation is a barebones starboard that can work on one discord server with minimal setup. No databases are required.
